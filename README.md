### Abstract

Quantum computers present an undeniable potential to solve classically intractable problems. However, the scalability of quantum architectures remains a principal challenge. A promising solution is the use of multi-core quantum ar- chitectures, which have to deal with new hardware and algorithmic challenges. The problem addressed in this work is partitioning quantum circuits among cores, which is an NP-hard problem. This thesis presents a novel approach for scalable circuit partitioning in multi-core quantum architectures using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with graph neural networks (GNN), which allows training circuits of different number of qubits, unlike previous work that is typically constrained to a fixed number. The findings highlight a starting point to the potential of combining DRL and GNNs for solving more complex quantum problems.
